ThreadPool
==========
== Introduction
This small library implements a pool of threads in C++ for a unix system with
support for POSIX threads. It is meant to run CPU-intensive tasks among the
different cores of the CPU.
Let's say the program has to perform an expensive task that can be splitted into
several parallel tasks. In this case you would like to spawn as many threads as
cores the CPU has and send a portion of the work to each of them. Then wait
until all threads have finished and, if needed, put all the answers together.
Creating threads is expensive. Each time a new thread is created the program
must ask the operating system to create the thread and allocate the resources
needed. The same situation occurs when threads are destroyed.  Depending on the
type or problem being solved this could be an issue or not.  For real-time
applications all these operations will create unnecesary latency.
Another option is to create a pool of threads when the application is started
and send them some work as needed. This is actually cleaner, more efficient and
faster than creating (and destroying) threads every time they are needed. It has
also an interesting consequence: we can easily do load balance across the
threads. Since the thread pool basically consists of a queue of jobs, we can
split the work in smaller units that will be assigned to any thread that is
available to perform the work. This will distribute the work evenly among the
threads and improve the performance when there is only a sub-set of CPU cores
performing the work.
The current implementation does not pretend to be a general solution for any
threading system.  On the contrary it is straightforward solution that works on
linux and is easy to understand.
== Usage
Work units
The threadpool receives jobs and saves them in an internal queue, these jobs
must be a subclass of the provided `ThreadPoolWorker`:
For example, if we want to define a work unit that takes one Body* parameter we
can define this class:
[source,cpp]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
class MyWorker: public ThreadPoolWorker {
	Body* body;
public:
	MyWorker(Body* _body) : body(_body) {}
	~MyWorker() {}
	void operator()()
	{
		// Do the work
	}
};
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Once we have defined the worker class we can use it:
[source,cpp]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ThreadPool pool(4); // Initialize the pool with a maximum of 4 OS threads
// ...
for (int i=0; i < bodies.size()) {
	pool.enqueueWork(new MyWorker(bodies[i])); // Enqueue work units
}
pool.waitEnd(); // Waint until all the work units have finished
// ...
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In this example 4 OS threads are created: the resources for 4 threads are
allocated and those will be competing for the real CPU cores. If the machine
where it runs has only 2 cores, 2 of those 4 threads will be executing at the
same time and the other 2 will remain waiting. Note that creating more threads
than the real number of cores is not necessarily a bad thing: if one of those
threads blocks (by an I/O operation for example) another thread will take its
CPU time to progress doing its work.
== Thread Local Storage
It is a common problem to need of a local variable to the thread this is usually
provided by some kind of Thread Local Storage. There is no ThreadLocalStorage
class in our code, instead we rely on the compiler's qualifier `__thread`, which
is implemented in our two target compilers GCC and CLANG. By using the
`__thread` qualifier we can have global variables than can only be used from a
specific thread. This is specially useful for cached data.
[source,cpp]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// In the global scope
__thread MyCache* thread_cache = NULL;
// In the worker:
if (thread_cache == NULL) {
	thread_cache = new MyCache();
}
// ...
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
